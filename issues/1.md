## Suggestion for LangChain Documentation

**Issue Title**: Update LangChain/ReadMe.md to Include Azure OpenAI Service Configuration

The API endpoint for Azure OpenAI Service differs from the standard OpenAI endpoint. 

### Suggestions:
- Add instructions for configuring the `ChatOpenAI` class with the correct Azure-specific details such as deployment name and endpoint URL.
- Include information on how to set up environment variables for the Azure OpenAI Service.

This will help users who are utilizing Azure services to seamlessly integrate with LangChain without confusion.
